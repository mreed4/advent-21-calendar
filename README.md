This one was challenging, and fun. In addition to the main ask of the challenge, I also added keyboard events and the ability to see the days from the previous and next month. Additional styling as well.

The biggest challenge was writing the logic to render days without a traditional HTML `table`. Instead, the code provided by challenge was `grid` based. In a sense this made it easier, and probably more performant, as there were no nested loops.

I did not use the _moment.js_ library, and instead used the native `Date` object.
